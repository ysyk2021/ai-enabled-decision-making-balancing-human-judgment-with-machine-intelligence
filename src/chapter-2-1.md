Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we make decisions. In this chapter, we will explore some of the tools and technologies that enable AI-enabled decision-making.

Machine Learning
----------------

Machine learning involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on historical data. By using machine learning, organizations can automate decision-making processes and make more informed decisions based on accurate predictions.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
---------------------------------

Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves teaching computers to understand human language. NLP can be used to analyze unstructured data such as social media posts or customer reviews, providing insights that inform decision-making.

Computer Vision
---------------

Computer vision involves teaching computers to interpret visual data such as images and videos. Computer vision can be used in various industries, from healthcare to manufacturing, to identify patterns and provide insights that inform decision-making.

Robotics
--------

Robotics involves developing machines that can perform tasks autonomously. By using robotics, organizations can automate routine tasks and free up human resources for more complex tasks.

Chatbots
--------

Chatbots are AI-powered conversational agents that can interact with humans through text or voice. Chatbots can be used in various industries, from customer service to healthcare, to automate routine tasks and provide support to customers.

Benefits of AI-Enabled Decision-Making Tools and Technologies
